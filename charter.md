# The eBPF Foundation Charter

The Linux Foundation
Amended 12 February, 2024

## 1) Mission and Scope of the eBPF Foundation.

#. The purpose of the eBPF Foundation (the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget
and spend funds in support of various open source, open data and/or open
standards projects relating to eBPF technologies, including infrastructure and
support initiatives related thereto (each project, a “Technical Project” as
as defined by the Project Progression Policy).

#. The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects.
The Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the Governing Board
of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the
“LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.

#. The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also
have working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively,
“Committees”) that may be established by either the Governing Board or the BSC
(as defined below).

## 2) Membership.

#. The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Silver and Associate Members
(each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All
Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to
participate in the Directed Fund as a member. All participants in the Directed
Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this
Charter, as from time to time amended with the approval of the LF. During the
term of their membership, all members will comply with all such policies as the
LF Board of Directors and/or the Directed Fund may adopt with notice to
members.

#. Platinum Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the
Governing Board and any Committee created by the Governing Board, but not the
BSC or any sub-committees established by the BSC.

#. Silver Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one
representative to the Governing Board for every five Silver Members, up to a
maximum of three representatives, provided that there will always be at least
one Silver Member representative, even if there are less than five Silver
Members. The Governing Board determines the election process.

#. The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members
of The Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for
joining the Directed Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a
membership organization, Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not
confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member.

#. Members will be entitled to:

   #. participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, events and
   any other activities; and

   #. identify themselves as members of the eBPF Foundation supporting the eBPF
   Foundation community.

## 3) Governing Board

#. The Governing Board voting members will consist of:

   #. one representative appointed by each Platinum Member;

   #. the elected Silver Member representative or representatives.

#. Only one Member that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in
Section 6) may appoint, or nominate for a membership class election, a
representative on the Governing Board.  No single Member, company or set of
Related Companies will be entitled to: (i) appoint or nominate for Membership
class election more than one representative for the Governing Board, or (ii)
have more than two representatives on the Governing Board.

#. Conduct of Meetings

   #. Governing Board meetings will be limited to the Governing Board
   representatives,  invited guests and LF staff.

   #. Governing Board meetings follow the requirements for quorum and voting
   outlined in this Charter. The Governing Board may decide whether to allow
   named representatives (one per Member per Governing Board and per Committee)
   to attend as an alternate.

   #. The Governing Board meetings will be private unless decided otherwise by
   the Governing Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in
   consideration of specific Governing Board topics (but such guest may not
   participate in any vote on any matter before the Governing Board).

#. Officers

   #. The officers (“Officers”) of the Directed Fund as of the first meeting of
   the Governing Board will be a Chairperson (“Chair”) and a Treasurer.
   Additional Officer positions may be created by the Governing Board.

   #. The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board, manage any
   day-to-day operational decisions, and will submit minutes for Governing
   Board approval.

   #. The Treasurer will assist in the preparation of budgets for Governing
   Board approval, monitor expenses against the budget and authorize
   expenditures approved in the budget.

#. The Governing Board will be responsible for overall management of the
Directed Fund, including:

   #. create Committees of the Governing Board;

   #. approve a budget directing the use of funds raised by the Directed Fund
   from all sources of revenue;

   #. nominate and elect Officers of the Directed Fund;

   #. overseeing all Directed Fund business matters and work with the LF on any
   legal matters that arise;

   #. adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for the Directed Fund
   (subject to LF approval);

   #. approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative
   of the Silver Members to the Governing Board and any Officer or other
   positions created by the Governing Board; and

   #. vote on all decisions or matters coming before the Governing Board.

## 4) eBPF Steering Committee (“BSC”)

#. The BSC is composed of maintainers from the eBPF community, including, the
Linux kernel, eBPF runtimes, and landscape projects. There can be at most two
representatives on the BSC employed by the same company or by Related
Companies.

#. The BSC will operate independently to facilitate the technical development
collaborations helpful to eBPF’s developer and user communities. The BSC will
be responsible for:

   #. coordinating collaboration within the eBPF community, including the
   development of an overall technical vision for the community;

   #. proposing community development activities to the Governing Board, and
   coordinating and evangelizing eBPF Projects and technologies to current and
   potential developers and users.

   #. defining requirements and the process for a project applying to become an
   eBPF Foundation Project;

   #. ensuring eBPF Foundation Projects follow all requirements for trademark
   and account ownership, and

   #. approving and maintaining an eBPF Foundation Project lifecycle policy
   that will address the incubation, archival and other stages and requirements
   of Technical Projects.

   #. proposing priorities to the Governing Board for events, travel funds, and
   other investments to grow the eBPF community of developers and users.

   #. identifying and facilitating areas of collaboration with adjacent open
   source communities to support eBPF’s use and adoption, such as communities
   focused on compilers, kernels, and debuggers; and

#. Expansion, Removal, and Vacancies

   #. Expansion:

      #. Any member of the BSC may propose a new member to the BSC. If
      supported by a second BSC member, the BSC will vote on acceptance of the
      new member.

      #. The GB (by decision of the GB) may nominate a new member to the BSC by
      a majority vote of the GB. The BSC will vote on the acceptance of the new
      BSC member.

      #. Acceptance of a new BSC member requires a two-thirds approval vote of
      the entire BSC.

   #. Removal

      #. Any member of the BSC may be removed by a two-thirds approval of the
      other BSC members. The member subject to a removal vote shall not be
      eligible to vote, shall not be counted as part of the quorum for the
      meeting during which the matter is considered, and shall not be
      considered in the calculation of vote results.

   #. Vacancies. If any member of the BSC is removed, resigns, or quietly
   resigns by virtue of being unreachable or disengaged for more than 60 days,
   a vacancy will exist.

      #. If the BSC has fewer than 9 members, any BSC member may nominate a new
      candidate to fill the vacancy. If there is only 1 nominee, the BSC may
      approve the nominee by a majority vote of the entire BSC. If there are
      multiple nominees, the nominees will be voted on by the BSC members using
      ranked choice voting, with the top selection winning the vacant seat.

      #. If the BSC has 9 or more members, the BSC may decide by majority vote
      whether to fill the vacancy or not, and any nominee will require a
      two-thirds approval of the entire BSC.

#. The BSC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure
minutes are taken and drive the BSC agenda with input from the BSC
representatives.

## 5) Voting

#. Quorum for Governing Board, BSC and other Committee meetings will require at
least sixty percent of the voting representatives. If advance notice of the
meeting has been given per normal means and timing, the Governing Board may
continue to meet even if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making
any decisions at the meeting.

#. Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision
requires a vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board,
BSC or Committee, as applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting
representative basis.

#. Except as provided in Section 13.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions
by vote at a meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is
met. Except as provided in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter,
decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all
voting representatives.

#. In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be
resolved by the Governing Board, BSC or other Committee, the Chair (in the case
of the Governing Board or BSC) or a Committee member (in the case other
Committees) may refer the matter to the Governing Board or BSC in the case of a
Committee or in the case of the Governing Board or the BSC, the LF for
assistance in reaching a decision.

## 6) Subsidiaries and Related Companies

#. Definitions:

   #. “Subsidiaries” means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or
   indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership
   interests of the entity in question;

   #. “Related Company” means any entity which controls or is controlled by a
   Member or which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a
   third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either
   directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the voting securities
   or membership interests of the entity in question; and

   #. “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a
   Member.

#. Only the legal entity which has executed a Participation Agreement and its
Subsidiaries will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such
Membership; provided, however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries will be
treated together as a single Member.

#. If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source
project, membership organization, user group or other entity that has members
or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member will extend
only to the employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or
sponsors, unless otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.

#. Directed Fund Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and
non-assignable, except a Member may transfer its current Membership benefits
and obligations to a successor of substantially all of its business or assets,
whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be
bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and policies required by LF membership.

## 7) Good Standing

#. The Linux Foundation’s Good Standing Policy is available at
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy and will apply to Members
of this Directed Fund.

#. All Members must encourage open participation from any organization able to
meet the membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put

any criteria, requirements or reasons other than those that are reasonable and
applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all members.

## 10) Budget

#. The Governing Board will approve an annual budget and never commit to spend
in excess of funds raised. The budget and the purposes to which it is applied
must be consistent with both (a) the non-profit and tax-exempt mission of The
Linux Foundation and (b) the aggregate goals of the Technical Projects.

#. The Linux Foundation will provide the Governing Board with regular reports
of spend levels against the budget. Under no circumstances will The Linux
Foundation have any expectation or obligation to undertake an action on behalf
of the Directed Fund or otherwise related to the Directed Fund that is not
covered in full by funds raised by the Directed Fund.

#. In the event an unbudgeted or otherwise unfunded obligation arises related
to the Directed Fund, The Linux Foundation will coordinate with the Governing
Board to address gap funding requirements.

## 11) General & Administrative Expenses

#. The Linux Foundation will have custody of and final authority over the usage
of any fees, funds and other cash receipts.

Board and confirmed by The Linux Foundation.

## 13) Amendments

#. This Charter may be amended by a 70% vote of the entire Governing Board and
BSC, subject to approval by The Linux Foundation.
